<h1>Chess</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Play a game of chess that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the chessboard and make moves smoothly.</li>

  
  <li><strong>Logical Moves:</strong> The game enforces the standard rules of chess, ensuring that only legal moves are allowed for each piece. It validates the player's moves based on the piece's type and the current state of the game.</li>

  
  <li><strong>Record of Moves:</strong> The game keeps track of all the moves made by both players during the game. Players can review the entire move history, allowing them to analyze their strategies and previous moves.</li>

  
  <li><strong>Check Detection:</strong> The game checks for situations where a player's king is in checked. If a player's king is under threat, it restricts them from making moves that leave the king in check.</li>

  
  <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it gets promoted to queen.</li>

  
  <li><strong>Castling:</strong> The game supports castling, a special move involving the king and a rook. If the conditions for castling are met, players can perform this move to enhance the king's safety and activate the rook.</li>

  <li><strong>Bots:</strong> Play against bots! In collaboration with my Chess Bot API(currently under development), play against calculated moves.</li>
